SSLScrobbler v0.6
=================

SSLScrobbler is a Scrobbler for Serato ScratchLive! (http://www.serato.com/) written in PHP.
See http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=99 for an explanation of Scrobbling.

SSLScrobbler is designed to update Last.fm and/or Twitter when a track is playing or played. 

SSLScrobbler could easily in future be hooked into a projector to show what's now playing,
a Twitter account, or used to control other actions based on track listing - Scrobbling is
only the first natural step!

ScratchLive itself logs plays to a binary history file during playback. This app reads the 
binary file and models what's going on. It sends you Growl popups when certain events 
happen, such as a track is loaded on the deck, set "Now Playing" or can be scrobbled.

The app works on OSX and Windows.

Running It
==========

OSX (Mac): 
 * double click "historyreader-mac"
 OR:
 * Open Terminal, 'cd' to the folder and type "./historyreader.php" for help and options

Windows:

 * Then start -> run -> "cmd", cd to the app, and type "php historyreader.php"
