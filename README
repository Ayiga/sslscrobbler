SSLScrobbler
============

SSLScrobbler is a Scrobbler for Serato ScratchLive! (http://www.serato.com/) written in PHP.
See http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=99 for an explanation of Scrobbling.

ScratchLive! logs plays to a binary history file during playback. The bulk of this app
is concerned with decoding the binary history file to retrieve the metadata.

So far this app is designed for use on OS X, although it may also work on Windows.

*** SSLScrobbler is currently incomplete, and makes no effort (yet) to be easy to install and use. ***
